*** Code ***

No semicolons

Use const and let

Use fat arrow functions over anonymous function declaration

use single quotes ' over double "


*** Git ***

Use brackets [] at the beginning of each commit
Do not add space between brackets and message
Use lowercase text
Use past tense (I wont be strict)

examples:
// [setup]npm and git init
// [feature]added calendar
// [bugfix]removed div that was causing alignment issue
// [refactor]made database query faster
